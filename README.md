# Programmers-Roulette
###  A "fun" game where your mouse pointer goes crazy...
#### **1 line only üòØ**

------------
### Requirements:
You need to have [Pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/ "Pyautogui") installed
### How to use:

Run the script
*Or*
Use cmd:
- Open cmd
- Start python in cmd
- Paste this line and click enter (twice) : 
`for i in range(50): import random;import pyautogui as ptg;import time;ptg.moveTo(random.randint(0,ptg.size()[0]), random.randint(0,ptg.size()[1]));time.sleep(0.2);ptg.doubleClick()`

### ‚ö†Ô∏èWarning:
- Your mouse pointer will go to random positions (on main screen) and will doubleclick. Programms may open or other (bad) things may happen. You can slam your mouse pointer to the top left corner to stop.
The mouse pointer will hover for `0.2` seconds (you can change that time as well) before doubleclicking.
- **This is just a joke and for fun and it is probably better if you do not run it.**
- I warned you and you are completely responsible if something happens.
- *Have fun!*
